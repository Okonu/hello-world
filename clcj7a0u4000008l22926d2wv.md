# Implementing Google Authentication with Express, Passport, and Node.js

Google authentication is a common way for users to log in to web applications. In this guide, we will walk through the steps of setting up **Google authentication** using the **Passport.js** library in a **Node.js** application with **Express**.

**Express** is a fast and flexible web application framework for **Node.js** that provides a range of features to help you create web and mobile applications. **Passport** is an authentication middleware for **Node.js** that supports authentication using various methods, including **Google OAuth**.

### **Prerequisites**

Before we begin, you should have the following:

* A basic understanding of Node.js and Express.
    
* A Google account and access to the Google Cloud Console.
    
* Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.
    

### **Setting Up the Project**

First, create a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies:

`$ mkdir google-auth-guide`

`$ cd google-auth-guide`

`$ npm init -y`

`$ npm i express passport passport-google-oauth20`

Next, create an `app.js` file and set up a basic Express server:

```javascript
const express = require('express'); const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send('Hello World!'); });

app.listen(3000, () => { console.log('Server listening on port 3000'); });
```

Run the server with node app.js, and you should see the message "Server listening on port 3000" in the console. If you visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, you should see the message "Hello World!"

### **Setting Up Google OAuth**

Now, we will set up Google OAuth so that users can log in to our application using their Google account.

First, go to the [**Google Cloud Console**](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project. Click "Enable APIs and Services" and search for the "Google+ API". Enable this API for your project.

Next, click on the "Credentials" tab and click "Create credentials" &gt; "OAuth client ID". Select "Web application" as the application type, and enter [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) as the authorized JavaScript origin and authorized redirect URI. Click "Create".

Google will provide you with a client ID and client secret. Save these somewhere safe, as you will need them later.

Now, let's configure Passport to use the Google strategy. In your `app.js` file, add the following code:

```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

passport.use(
  new GoogleStrategy(
    {
      clientID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
      clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
      callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback',
    },
    (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) => {
      // Save the user to your database here
      return cb(null, profile);
    }
  )
);
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the client ID and client secret that Google provided you.

### **Adding Google Login and Logout Routes (Continued)**

To make it easy for users to log in and out, you should add a login and logout link to your application.

First, check if the user is authenticated in your application's layout template (e.g. `layout.pug`):

```plaintext
- if (user)
  a(href="/logout") Logout
- else
  a(href="/auth/google") Login with Google
```

Then, pass the `user` object to the template when rendering it. In your routes, add the following code:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { user: req.user });
});
```

Now, when the user is logged in, they will see a "Logout" link, and when they are logged out, they will see a "Login with Google" link.

### Wrapping it up...

We have walked through the steps of setting up Google authentication in a Node.js application with Express and Passport. We have also covered how to protect routes and add a login and logout link to your application.
